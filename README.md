# CPP_Practice_July8th

Practice, practice and more practice....this is the advice which afamous Indian magician PC Sorkar Senior gave to magician PC 
Sorkar junior. 

I heard this line many years ago in TV program, when PC Sorkar junior was interviewed

This is the basic fundamental and is applicable in all the spheres of the life.

Same thing I am applying over here with an aim to become experienced C++ programmer and over the period of time master other languages.
